# Binary Tree Lowest Common Ancestor Finder
## Overview
This C++ program implements a binary tree and a function to find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two nodes in the tree. The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q in a binary tree is the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants.
## Components
  + Node Structure: Defines a structure for a node in the binary tree. Each node contains a value and pointers to its left and right child nodes.
  + Tree Class: Implements a class for the binary tree. It includes a function common() to find the lowest common ancestor.
  + Main Function: Creates a binary search tree and finds the lowest common ancestor of two specified nodes (p and q).
## Usage
To use this program, simply compile the source code using a C++ compiler and run the resulting executable. Ensure you have a compatible C++ compiler installed on your system.
## Notes
  + This program assumes the input binary tree is a binary search tree (BST).
  + Ensure proper memory management to avoid memory leaks, especially when dynamically allocating memory for nodes.
